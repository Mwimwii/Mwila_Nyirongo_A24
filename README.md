React Test

My code for the React can be forked and run here: 
[Used Stackblitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ts-4vezdd)
(Typescript/React/CSS)

- step1: created a component that displays the live width of the browser window
- step2: added a text input that, as a number is entered into it, uses that number to set the height of the div itself in pixels, live as you update the text field (keypress not change event)
- step3: added a HOC that allows you to set the height of the div from the external function setDivHeight().
